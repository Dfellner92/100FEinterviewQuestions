### Name some CSS properties

Some to talk about: ```font-weight```, will allow you to make font thinner or bolder, ```font-size``` to change the pixel value. ```margin``` is used to create space outside of defined borders, ```padding``` is used to create space within defined borders, ```border``` can change the dimension of the borders, and each of these can be specified in terms of direction. ```display``` which could make an element displayed inlined with the rest of the row or blocked which gives it a new row, ```position``` which allows for absolute positioning, to fix an element relative to its first positioned parent. ```box-sizing``` will allow for a border box to account for borders of other elements to fix its size accordingly.

### visibility: hidden v display: none

if you had 2 150x150px divs on top of each other, the top green and the bottom red each with its own id for background-color, you could apply ```visibility: hidden``` on the green and it'd keep the red div in place as it simply looks invisible with its height and width still applied. However, ```display: none``` will make it appear as if the div has disappeared altogether, and the red div would move up in its place.

### CSS terminology

A CSS file typically contains defined ```selctors``` (id, classes, and tags within the HTML) The selectors contain ```properties```, which cause the selector to alter, usually specified by the property name. The way the properties are altered is through assigning them a ```value```. For example we could have the property font-height: and give it the value 20px. Together, the property and its value form a ```declaration```. Together, all the declarations of selector class form the ```rules```

### Data attributes

- Existed since IE 7/8, exists in all modern browsers
- Allows for data keys to be passed from the template to javascript
- Big use: allows for help on test driven dev: 
`data-test` can be used so that Quality assurance tools like cypress or mocha can use hooks associated with template elements without using classes or ids. 

### class vs id

a class is denoted by the ```.``` prefix, an id is denoted by the ```#``` prefix. id is meant to be more specific than a class, used only for one (although you could use it for more than one but most would consider this bad practice) Due to id having a higher specificity, it can overwrite class styles.

### CSS specificity

CSS specificity deals with what selectors get applied to certain elements based on inheritance. If you had a ```*``` (universal selector), with a ```color: red``` declaration, it'd be overruled by the color declaration of an h1 selector. That would be overruled by the class selctor, which would be overruled by the id selector, and then the most specific would be inline styling. 

### responsive design

Media queries allow us to have breakpoints in the browser width that allow for style changes. There is also the more outdated bootstrap 12 column grid, but now CSS flexbox allows us to have these dimensions built in natively.

### CSS box model

The box model is how certain properties work around each element. It begins with the element, the padding surrounding it, then the border, then the margin, which moves it away from other box models.

### CSS preprocessors

Why would you use a preprocessor like SASS? It allows for variables and nesting of variables which allow for cleaner code. Being able to see the scope helps legibility. Mixins allow for code to be reused much easier as rules can be added to new selectors much quicker and cleaner.

### Pseudo class

Additional selector type that orders elements around pages or affects user interactions. Pseudo classes are denoted by the colon in front of various classes like ```hover```. They can also be used to make every nth row colored differently, for instance.

### Pseudo elements

- Pseudo classes reflect state upon page, pseudo elements they're dealing with the actual elements on the page (not things like an anchor tag)
- denoted by ```::```, not ```:```
- ```p::before``` or ```p::after``` are the key ones, can set ```content``` to inject before what is in the ```p``` tag

### Create a circle

Create a div with an id selector ```#ciricle``` attached to it. In the stylesheet, create a selector class that gives #circle background-color of red, height: 100px, width: 100px; and finally, a border-radius of 50%.

### semantic HTML

Semantic elements were introduced in HTML5 with the aim to have more specific tag names that would replace id selector conventions that had become standardized. These included ```<div id="footer">``` or ```<div id="section">``` and are now replaced with ```<nav>``` and ```<footer>``` tags. These better named containers help improve workflow as well as SEO.

### head tag

The head tag is used to store external dependencies in a ```.html``` file, like a stylesheet or a script file. It also is used to store ```<meta>``` tags that contain information about the title, if you're going to allow responsive functionality, containing SEO and more. It should be worth noting that the head tag doesn't render any features to the DOM.

### meta tags

```<meta charset="UTF-8">``` is used to define the characters we're using. ```<meta description="my seo here...">``` is where the SEO keywords can go, you could also use ```keyword=" "```. ```<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">``` is a very common tag that frames the users view of the content. ```width``` controls how the view is scaled for the device used, and ```initial-scale``` indicates that we're not zooming in. 

### div vs span

```<span>``` tags are mainly for assigning classes or ids to specific points within a row. This is because span is an inline level element and ```<div>``` is a block level element.

### accessability

Accessability allows for companies to attract a bigger client base, and allow for easier access for people with disabilities. One way to do this is by applying an ```aria-label``` to tags, say a ```<button>``` that make it so an operating system can voice over the label and the tag.

### CSS custom properties

These are essentially CSS variables, the name of each is defined with a ```--``` before the name of the property. Typically, the variables are defined in a ```:root {}``` selector for global scope. If you were to use the same heading color for multiple tags, you could define ```--headingColor: green``` within the root selector, and then on each selector you want to apply green, you could have the declaration read ```color: var(--headingColor)```

### CSS principles

Block element modifiers are one way to organize CSS class names. The block is a general element that can stand on its own. The elements have no meaning on their own and are semantically tied to their blocks. Modifiers allow for small things to change within the element. Typically, the naming convention is: ```block__element--modifier```.
Applying atomic design is another means of having a top-down method of CSS rendering.

### Install a font

One way to go about this is to add the fonts stylesheet link to the head section of the html file. You could also use the ```@import url('')``` method at the top of the styles.

### Add CSS

You could add CSS inline to an element with the ```style=""``` attribute, but this is not best practice. You could have the ```<style>``` tag in the head but this also causes separation of concerns issues. Finally, there is what is considered best CSS practice which is to have an external stylesheet(s) where we could import to the html with a link tag in the head and an ```href``` to the ```styles.css``` file.

### Vendor Prefix



### CSS grid vs flexbox

Both can handle CSS responsive design well. CSS grid allows you to order items easier, taking both a horizontal and vertical approach. Flexbox is much better for single direction. Grid is easier to apply to the full scope of the application while Flexbox allows us to organize the pieces of individual components easier. 

### CSS libraries

The pros of using a library are if you aren't the best at CSS styling (and the project allows for the use of a library) it could make the tasks easier, or if you're designing a back-office tool, where the designs don't matter as much. Bootstrap, for instance, also has a javascript library as well that works in conjunction with many of their CSS components. Using a library can also allow you to do away with a global stylesheet altogether should you choose to not have any custom styles. 

The downsides to using a library include having to use a lot of classes and making the html "bulky". A lot of developers also rely heavily on libraries and this can make their custom styling skills diminish.

### Z index

The Z index allows us to lay items on top of one another. Say a background takes up the entire screen despite being responsive; the Z-index will allow for the other components to be placed in front.
