### Javascript Data Types

In terms of Data types, you have the primative data types, 
which consist of the boolean (true, false,) numbers - which could be
any type (floating point, whole,) null, which is an empty value that is 
assigned, undefined, which has no value, and strings. Then there are
non primitives, which include arrays and objects, (yes, arrays are objects 
but they operate and are manipulated differently.) Maps and Sets would be
said to be objects if used ```typeof``` but they are also distinct data
structures, if not data types.
